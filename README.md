# BarkBeetle

## Image processing to detect bark beetle infestation from aerial orthomosaics

**Tools**: Python3, ImageMagick, and zsh

**Python libraries**: Pillow (PIL), NumPy, SciPy, OpenCV (cv2), matplotlib

The *input orthomosaics* are available
at [my personal website](https://elisa.dyndns-web.com/BarkBeetle/)
(they are too large to host at GitHub).
