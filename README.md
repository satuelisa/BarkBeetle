# BarkBeetle

## Image processing to detect BBI from aerial imagery

We work with UAV-captured RGB images, built into one-per-flight
orthomosaics, to detect bark-beetle infestations.

**Tools**: Python3, ImageMagick, and zsh

**Python libraries**: Pillow (PIL), NumPy, SciPy, OpenCV (cv2), matplotlib

The *input orthomosaics* are available
at [my personal website](https://elisa.dyndns-web.com/BarkBeetle/)
(they are too large to host at GitHub).
